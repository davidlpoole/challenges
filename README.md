# Merge Sort and Factory Function demo app

A repo to host some coding challenges I've been set, and also just to play around with Deno/Fresh.

### Stack

Deno, Fresh, Preact, Tailwind CSS

### Usage

Install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

### Running tests

```
deno test
```
